## Submission Instructions

### Overview
	
	When picking out what shows to watch on streaming services, it can be difficult in locating
where these shows and movies can be watched.  I do not know of any comprehensive list of streaming media,
so I want to make one.  My project will allow users to search the database for information on the media 
they want to watch.  This will include information such as title, genre, what streaming service(s)
it can be found on, number of seasons, and a possible rating system I could implement.
Search and browse functionality would make this process easier for the user.

### Features
Include Features here

1) Database - my website will offer information on streaming service media in an effort
to help users find where they can stream said media.

2)Browse Functionality - Users will be able to browse through listings of streaming service
media.  A system of filters can make this easier, such as filtering by genre or 
a certain streaming service.

3) Search Functionality = Users will be able to search for particular titles.  

4) Dynamic Front End - I want to create a beautiful website that works with the users.

5) Rating System = This is something I'm thinking of doing later.  The users could rate
the media, giving them one to five stars.  The average rating would be displayed to all users.
